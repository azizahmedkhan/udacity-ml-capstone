    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Lendingclub.com is one of the leading online p2p lending platforms, where lenders are matched directly to borrowers. Since its inception in 2007, the total amount of loan reaches almost 8 billion US dollars. There are two ways to invest on lendingclub.com: automatic investing and manual investing. In automatic investing, investors specify the amount of risk they are willing to take, and lendingclub automatically invest their money in a mixed portfolio constructed using their algorithms given the risk. For manual investing, investors can browse the notes and the borrowers' information, and select which notes and how much amount they would like to invest. Furthermore, investors don't necessarily have to browser all the notes, instead they can download those data, use their own algorithm to identify which borrowers to lend their money and process them in a batch fashion. Lendingclub provides historical loan information so that one can build machine learning algorithms to predict loan performances. This project aims at identifying loans that may default so that borrowers can avoid those loans using manual investing. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many similar efforts at predicting defaults using lendingclub data [1-7]. Although the goal of predicting default is the same, there are differences in feature selection, learning algorithms employed and metrics used for evaluating the model performance. In particular, some of the high performing models (for example, Ref [1]) incorrectly used fico scores that were produced after a loan is default, thus the results are highly misleading. Other analysis [2-7] use only numerical and categorical features but ignoring text. The most comprehensive feature engineering effort comes from Ref. [8], however, they use a different dataset and their goal is to report whether a loan defaults and how much is the loss if a loan defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "In this project, I propose to predict whether a borrower will default so that investors can avoid those borrowers using manual investing feature provided by lendingclub. This, however, does not necessarily lead to highest return on investment (ROI) because by completely avoiding potential defaults, one also avoid riskier loans that may lead to higher ROI even though they default at some point in the future. In order to maximize ROI, one needs to optimize ROI instead. In this project, we work on the simpler problem, that is to predict loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting loan defaults is a binary classification problem: a borrower either default at some time during the loan term or finish payment. In reality, the majority of lendingclub loans are between default and full payment, that is, these loans are on-going. Since investors can only invest in lendingclub notes at initial stage, which means investor can not jump into on-going loans, those on-going loans are irrelevant to our discussion. A binary classification problem is a classic machine learning problem with multiple machine learning algorithms to choose from, has quantitative metrics, such as accuracy, precision, f1 score, etc. to measure the results, and is replicable with the same data and machine learning model.\n",

    "The dataset comes from lendingclub website `DOWNLOAD LOAN DATA` section: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action. According to the website, these files contain complete loan data for all loans issued from 2007 through 2016 Q3. In the following, I will load the dataset and present basic information and statistics."

    "#### Basic information\n",
    "According to the above analysis, there are 1,218,316 rows and 115 columns in the loan dataset, with one loan example  shown in the cell above. The 115 columns include information such as borrowers' credit history (such as fico score), personal information (such as annual income, years of employment, zipcode, etc.), loan information (description, type, interest rate, grade, etc.), current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest credit and payment information. You can find the dictionary for the definitions of all data attributes [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx). Since there are too many columns, I will selectly explain a few most important columns/features in the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features \n",
    "Among those columns, I will use loan information, credit history, personal information as features, and discard columns related to latest credit and payment information. Features include but not limited to (partly shown for simplicity): \n",
    " - `funded_amnt`: funded amount \n",
    " - `term`: term of the loan (36 or 60 months)\n",
    " - `grade`: grade of the loan (A to G)\n",
    " - `int_rate`: interest rate\n",
    " - `emp_length`: employment length\n",
    " - `home_ownership`: own, mortgage, rent, or other\n",
    " - `annual_inc`: annual income\n",
    " - `dti`: debt to income ratio\n",
    " - `delinq_2yrs`: delinquency within last 2 years\n",
    " - `fico_range_low`: fico score, lower one\n",
    " - `fico_range_high`: fico score, higher one\n",
    " - `inq_last_6mths`: inquiry within last 6 months\n",
    " - `purpose`: purpose of the loan\n",
    " \n",
    "These and related features have been widely used for default prediction [1-8]. There are three types of data in the dataset: numerical, categorical and text. I plan to use all types. Some numerical variables will be converted to categorical ones, and vice versa; text will be treated using bag-of-words representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that shall not be used\n",
    "In some of the previous work [1, 2], latest credit information such as `last_fico_range_low` and `last_fico_range_high` were used for prediction and lead to high model performance. However, these features are pulled recently according to the date specified in the `last_credit_pull_d` column. Thus the scores were obtained after a loan was fully paid or default, and their high predictive power is a false illusion because low fico score is the consequence of default but is not a predictor for default. As a result, I will exclude them from features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that have lots of NULL values\n",
    "In the following I show the percentage of NULL values for each column that has over 10% NULL data. The percentage data here is only for illustration only, because the actual number will change after data preprocessing detailed in Data Preprocessing section."

From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here.

It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process.

    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis).

    "In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis.

It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_\n",
