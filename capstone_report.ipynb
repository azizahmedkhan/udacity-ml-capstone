    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Lendingclub.com is one of the leading online p2p lending platforms, where lenders are matched directly to borrowers. Since its inception in 2007, the total amount of loan reaches almost 8 billion US dollars. There are two ways to invest on lendingclub.com: automatic investing and manual investing. In automatic investing, investors specify the amount of risk they are willing to take, and lendingclub automatically invest their money in a mixed portfolio constructed using their algorithms given the risk. For manual investing, investors can browse the notes and the borrowers' information, and select which notes and how much amount they would like to invest. Furthermore, investors don't necessarily have to browser all the notes, instead they can download those data, use their own algorithm to identify which borrowers to lend their money and process them in a batch fashion. Lendingclub provides historical loan information so that one can build machine learning algorithms to predict loan performances. This project aims at identifying loans that may default so that borrowers can avoid those loans using manual investing. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many similar efforts at predicting defaults using lendingclub data [1-7]. Although the goal of predicting default is the same, there are differences in feature selection, learning algorithms employed and metrics used for evaluating the model performance. In particular, some of the high performing models (for example, Ref [1-2]) incorrectly used fico scores that were produced after a loan is default, thus the results are highly misleading. Other analysis [3-7] select few features and ignore most of features available in the lendingclub dataset. The most comprehensive feature engineering effort comes from Ref. [8], however, they use a different dataset and their goal is to report whether a loan defaults and how much is the loss if a loan defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "In this project, I propose to predict whether a borrower will default so that investors can avoid those borrowers using manual investing feature provided by lendingclub. This, however, does not necessarily lead to highest return on investment (ROI) because by completely avoiding potential defaults, one also avoid riskier loans that may lead to higher ROI even though they default at some point in the future. In order to maximize ROI, one needs to optimize ROI instead. In this project, we work on the simpler problem, that is to predict loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting loan defaults is a binary classification problem: a borrower either default at some time during the loan term or finish payment. In reality, the majority of lendingclub loans are between default and full payment, that is, these loans are on-going. Since investors can only invest in lendingclub notes at initial stage, which means investor can not jump into on-going loans, those on-going loans are irrelevant to our discussion. A binary classification problem is a classic machine learning problem with multiple machine learning algorithms to choose from, has quantitative metrics, such as accuracy, precision, f1 score, etc. to measure the results, and is replicable with the same data and machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "The machine learning task here is an imbalanced two-classed classification, with loan default represents around 20% of all data. Typically f1-score is used for imbalanced classification, however I found that there are two very different f1-scores, depends on which class one is predicting. Instead here I choose area under curve (AUC) as metrics to evaluate learning performance. According to Ref. [9], AUC is a common evaluation metric for binary classification problems. Consider a plot of the true positive rate vs the false positive rate as the threshold value for classifying an item as 0 or is increased from 0 to 1: if the classifier is very good, the true positive rate will increase quickly and the area under the curve will be close to 1. If the classifier is no better than random guessing, the true positive rate will increase linearly with the false positive rate and the area under the curve will be around 0.5. One characteristic of the AUC is that it is independent of the fraction of the test population which is class 0 or class 1: this makes the AUC useful for evaluating the performance of classifiers on unbalanced data sets."

    "#### Basic information\n",
    "According to the above analysis, there are 1,218,316 rows and 115 columns in the loan dataset, with one loan example  shown in the cell above. The 115 columns include information such as borrowers' credit history (such as fico score), personal information (such as annual income, years of employment, zipcode, etc.), loan information (description, type, interest rate, grade, etc.), current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest credit and payment information. You can find the dictionary for the definitions of all data attributes [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx). Since there are too many columns, I will selectly explain a few most important columns/features in the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features \n",
    "Among those columns, I will use loan information, credit history, personal information as features, and discard columns related to latest credit and payment information. Features include but not limited to (partly shown for simplicity): \n",
    " - `funded_amnt`: funded amount \n",
    " - `term`: term of the loan (36 or 60 months)\n",
    " - `grade`: grade of the loan (A to G)\n",
    " - `int_rate`: interest rate\n",
    " - `emp_length`: employment length\n",
    " - `home_ownership`: own, mortgage, rent, or other\n",
    " - `annual_inc`: annual income\n",
    " - `dti`: debt to income ratio\n",
    " - `delinq_2yrs`: delinquency within last 2 years\n",
    " - `fico_range_low`: fico score, lower one\n",
    " - `fico_range_high`: fico score, higher one\n",
    " - `inq_last_6mths`: inquiry within last 6 months\n",
    " - `purpose`: purpose of the loan\n",
    " \n",
    "These and related features have been widely used for default prediction [1-8]. There are three types of data in the dataset: numerical, categorical and text. I plan to use all types. Some numerical variables will be converted to categorical ones, and vice versa; text will be treated using bag-of-words representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that shall not be used\n",
    "In some of the previous work [1, 2], latest credit information such as `last_fico_range_low` and `last_fico_range_high` were used for prediction and lead to high model performance. However, these features are pulled recently according to the date specified in the `last_credit_pull_d` column. Thus the scores were obtained after a loan was fully paid or default, and their high predictive power is a false illusion because low fico score is the consequence of default but is not a predictor for default. As a result, I will exclude them from features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that have lots of NULL values\n",
    "In the following I show the percentage of NULL values for each column that has over 10% NULL data. The percentage data here is only for illustration only, because the actual number will change after data preprocessing detailed in Data Preprocessing section."

The second type is truly missing information, for example, `desc` (description provided by borrowers), `open_acc_6m` and all other columns that has 71.0935% missing data (these are columns that were only recently populated thus missing in previous years). The third type is a mix of the first two types, for example, `mths_since_last_major_derog` is meaningful, yet carefully exam the data shows that the first 10% of loan data is missing.

Further exam of the data (didn't show here) indicates that loans with fico score between 600 and 650 are the one with `loan_status` \"Does not meet the credit policy\" but nevertheless issued.

The reason for the high loan default rate around 2008 is due to financial crisis. The reason for high loan default rate after 2014 is: a typical loan lasts 3 to 5 years, for loans initiated after 2014 most of people are still paying (thus removed from the dataset) and people who already default is included in the dataset and over-represents the population.

    "The loan dataset is a time-series dataset with over 400,000 rows and imbalanced data (20% of data belongs to one class), has both numeric and categorical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification algorithms\n",
    "There are many machine learning algorithms to perform classification. Since the current dataset is relatively large with over 400,000 rows, algorithms such as Support Vector Machine and K-nearest Neighbor will take too long to train and won't be used here. Here I intend to use Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and Ensemble Methods (AdaBoost, Random Forest), all available in sklearn.\n",
    "- Naive Bayes is a simple, fast for large dataset, yet powerful method. It assumes each feature is independent of each other; yet it can perform fairly well even when features are not independent such as in spam classification. It is served as a baseline algorithm for the classification task here. \n",
    "- Logistic Regression is another simple, fast yet powerful methods. Its a linear model and can not handle non-linear relationships between features. \n",
    "- Ensemble Methods combine the results of many base models (weak learners), can handle categorical variables and outliers very well, and can handle non-linear relationship between features. Although its relatively slower to train compared to Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression, the training time is still reasonable given the current dataset size. \n",

    "#### Under or over-sampling for imbalanced data\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Rolling cross valication on time-series data\n",
    "With time-series data, if random or stratified cross-validation split is performed, we might end up predicting earlier loans using later loans, which is not reasonable. A better way is to perform rolling cross validation (forward chaining) according to Ref. [10], where set 1-6 are time-ordered data: \n",

I also chose three different resampling methods (None, random under sampling and random over sampling) to balence the dataset. Finally, 5-fold rolling cross-validation results are reported for both training and testing set for each classifier and resampler."

The training and testing scores are similar using Naive Bayes and Logisitic Regression. On the other hand, for Random Forest, there's a large gap between training and testing score, meaning Random Forest siginficantly overfit, and model parameters shall be used to enhance the model performance.

    "_(approx. 2-3 pages)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_\n",
    "- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_\n",
    "- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_\n",
    "- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_\n",
    "- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. Conclusion\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 pages)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free-Form Visualization\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_\n",
    "- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_\n",
    "- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_\n",
    "- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before submitting, ask yourself. . .**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the project report you’ve written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?\n",
    "- Is each section (particularly **Analysis** and **Methodology**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?\n",
    "- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your analysis, methods, and results?\n",
    "- Have you properly proof-read your project report to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?\n",
    "- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?\n",
    "- Is the code that implements your solution easily readable and properly commented?\n",
    "- Does the code execute without error and produce results similar to those reported?"
