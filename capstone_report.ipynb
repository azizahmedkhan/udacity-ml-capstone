    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Lendingclub.com is one of the leading online p2p lending platforms, where lenders are matched directly to borrowers. Since its inception in 2007, the total amount of loan reaches almost 8 billion US dollars. There are two ways to invest on lendingclub.com: automatic investing and manual investing. In automatic investing, investors specify the amount of risk they are willing to take, and lendingclub automatically invest their money in a mixed portfolio constructed using their algorithms given the risk. For manual investing, investors can browse the notes and the borrowers' information, and select which notes and how much amount they would like to invest. Furthermore, investors don't necessarily have to browser all the notes, instead they can download those data, use their own algorithm to identify which borrowers to lend their money and process them in a batch fashion. Lendingclub provides historical loan information so that one can build machine learning algorithms to predict loan performances. This project aims at identifying loans that may default so that borrowers can avoid those loans using manual investing. \n",
    "\n",
    "There have been many similar efforts at predicting defaults using lendingclub data [1-7]. Although the goal of predicting default is the same, there are differences in feature selection, learning algorithms employed and metrics used for evaluating the model performance. In particular, some of the high performing models (for example, Ref [1]) incorrectly used fico scores that were produced after a loan is default, thus the results are highly misleading. Other analysis [2-7] use only numerical and categorical features but ignoring text. The most comprehensive feature engineering effort comes from Ref. [8], however, they use a different dataset and their goal is to report whether a loan defaults and how much is the loss if a loan defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "In this project, I propose to predict whether a borrower will default so that investors can avoid those borrowers using manual investing feature provided by lendingclub. This, however, does not necessarily lead to highest return on investment (ROI) because by completely avoiding potential defaults, one also avoid riskier loans that may lead to higher ROI even though they default at some point in the future. In order to maximize ROI, one needs to optimize ROI instead. In this project, we work on the simpler problem, that is to predict loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting loan defaults is a binary classification problem: a borrower either default at some time during the loan term or finish payment. In reality, the majority of lendingclub loans are between default and full payment, that is, these loans are on-going. Since investors can only invest in lendingclub notes at initial stage, which means investor can not jump into on-going loans, those on-going loans are irrelevant to our discussion. A binary classification problem is a classic machine learning problem with multiple machine learning algorithms to choose from, has quantitative metrics, such as accuracy, precision, f1 score, etc. to measure the results, and is replicable with the same data and machine learning model.\n",

    "The dataset comes from lendingclub website `DOWNLOAD LOAN DATA` section: https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action. According to the website, these files contain complete loan data for all loans issued from 2007 through 2016 Q3. In the following, I will load the dataset and present basic information and statistics."

    "#### Basic information\n",
    "According to the above analysis, there are 1,218,316 rows and 115 columns in the loan dataset, with one loan example  shown in the cell above. The 115 columns include information such as borrowers' credit history (such as fico score), personal information (such as annual income, years of employment, zipcode, etc.), loan information (description, type, interest rate, grade, etc.), current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest credit and payment information. You can find the dictionary for the definitions of all data attributes [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx). Since there are too many columns, I will selectly explain a few most important columns/features in the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features \n",
    "Among those columns, I will use loan information, credit history, personal information as features, and discard columns related to latest credit and payment information. Features include but not limited to (partly shown for simplicity): \n",
    " - `funded_amnt`: funded amount \n",
    " - `term`: term of the loan (36 or 60 months)\n",
    " - `grade`: grade of the loan (A to G)\n",
    " - `int_rate`: interest rate\n",
    " - `emp_length`: employment length\n",
    " - `home_ownership`: own, mortgage, rent, or other\n",
    " - `annual_inc`: annual income\n",
    " - `dti`: debt to income ratio\n",
    " - `delinq_2yrs`: delinquency within last 2 years\n",
    " - `fico_range_low`: fico score, lower one\n",
    " - `fico_range_high`: fico score, higher one\n",
    " - `inq_last_6mths`: inquiry within last 6 months\n",
    " - `purpose`: purpose of the loan\n",
    " \n",
    "These and related features have been widely used for default prediction [1-8]. There are three types of data in the dataset: numerical, categorical and text. I plan to use all types. Some numerical variables will be converted to categorical ones, and vice versa; text will be treated using bag-of-words representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that shall not be used\n",
    "In some of the previous work [1, 2], latest credit information such as `last_fico_range_low` and `last_fico_range_high` were used for prediction and lead to high model performance. However, these features are pulled recently according to the date specified in the `last_credit_pull_d` column. Thus the scores were obtained after a loan was fully paid or default, and their high predictive power is a false illusion because low fico score is the consequence of default but is not a predictor for default. As a result, I will exclude them from features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns that have lots of NULL values\n",
    "In the following I show the percentage of NULL values for each column that has over 10% NULL data. The percentage data here is only for illustration only, because the actual number will change after data preprocessing detailed in Data Preprocessing section."

Further exam of the data (didn't show here) indicates that loans with fico score between 600 and 650 are the one with `loan_status` \"Does not meet the credit policy\" but nevertheless issued.

    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?_\n",
    "- _Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?_\n",
    "- _Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Refinement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to discuss the process of improvement you made upon the algorithms and techniques you used in your implementation. For example, adjusting parameters for certain models to acquire improved solutions would fall under the refinement category. Your initial and final solutions should be reported, as well as any significant intermediate results as necessary. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Has an initial solution been found and clearly reported?_\n",
    "- _Is the process of improvement clearly documented, such as what techniques were used?_\n",
    "- _Are intermediate and final solutions clearly reported as the process is improved?_\n",

    "## IV. Results\n",
    "_(approx. 2-3 pages)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation and Validation\n",
    "In this section, the final model and any supporting qualities should be evaluated in detail. It should be clear how the final model was derived and why this model was chosen. In addition, some type of analysis should be used to validate the robustness of this model and its solution, such as manipulating the input data or environment to see how the model’s solution is affected (this is called sensitivity analysis). Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Is the final model reasonable and aligning with solution expectations? Are the final parameters of the model appropriate?_\n",
    "- _Has the final model been tested with various inputs to evaluate whether the model generalizes well to unseen data?_\n",
    "- _Is the model robust enough for the problem? Do small perturbations (changes) in training data or the input space greatly affect the results?_\n",
    "- _Can results found from the model be trusted?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "In this section, your model’s final solution and its results should be compared to the benchmark you established earlier in the project using some type of statistical analysis. You should also justify whether these results and the solution are significant enough to have solved the problem posed in the project. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are the final results found stronger than the benchmark result reported earlier?_\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly analyzed and discussed the final solution?_\n",
    "- _Is the final solution significant enough to have solved the problem?_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## V. Conclusion\n",
    "_(approx. 1-2 pages)_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Free-Form Visualization\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?_\n",
    "- _Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?_\n",
    "- _If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?_\n",
    "- _If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?_\n",

    "\n",
    "- Does the project report you’ve written follow a well-organized structure similar to that of the project template?\n",
    "- Is each section (particularly **Analysis** and **Methodology**) written in a clear, concise and specific fashion? Are there any ambiguous terms or phrases that need clarification?\n",
    "- Would the intended audience of your project be able to understand your analysis, methods, and results?\n",
    "- Have you properly proof-read your project report to assure there are minimal grammatical and spelling mistakes?\n",
    "- Are all the resources used for this project correctly cited and referenced?\n",
    "- Is the code that implements your solution easily readable and properly commented?\n",
    "- Does the code execute without error and produce results similar to those reported?"
